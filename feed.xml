I’ve been playing their game Number Match and it’s pretty fun. The game is relatively straight forward: match pairs of numbers and clear the board. It’s a grid of 3x9 squares initialized with numbers from 1 to 9. You can pair numbers that are adjacent to one another horizontally, vertically and diagonally. Additionally, you can pair a numbe... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>The Stupid Games I Play: Wordzee</title><link href="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/wordzee/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="The Stupid Games I Play: Wordzee" /><published>2022-11-11T00:00:00-06:00</published> <updated>2023-04-17T17:48:37-05:00</updated> <id>https://jiduque.github.io/posts/wordzee/</id> <content src="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/wordzee/" /> <author> <name>Jorge Duque</name> </author> <category term="Games" /> <category term="Math" /> <summary> Lately I’ve been playing this game called Wordzee a lot and have been wanting to do a mathematical analysis on it. I’m mainly interested in two things about this game: strategies &amp;amp; the most points you could have in a game. In this article, I will go over the latter expect another post about this game at some point in the future. How You Play The Game Wordzee is a two-player turn-based word... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Cute Counter</title><link href="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/cute-counter/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Cute Counter" /><published>2022-08-27T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-08-31T20:06:22-05:00</updated> <id>https://jiduque.github.io/posts/cute-counter/</id> <content src="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/cute-counter/" /> <author> <name>Jorge Duque</name> </author> <category term="Algorithms" /> <category term="Probability" /> <summary> The Problem Even though counting seems like an easy problem, it can have its difficulties. When data is streaming, we assume a nearly endless influx of data. This means that when we are counting something, we could reach some large numbers. We would like to get a way to estimate large counts, but use memory efficiently. Moris’s Algorithm Moris’s Algorithm is a clever solution for this. The alg... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Wealth Distribution</title><link href="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/wealth-distribution/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Wealth Distribution" /><published>2022-06-08T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-08-27T16:35:23-05:00</updated> <id>https://jiduque.github.io/posts/wealth-distribution/</id> <content src="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/wealth-distribution/" /> <author> <name>Jorge Duque</name> </author> <category term="Simulations" /> <category term="Agent-Based Models" /> <summary> Agent Based Models While in graduate school I took one of the most fascinating courses I’ve taken: agent-based models. In short, it’s a model where there are $N$ “agents” with some value(s) of interest that changes based on some “simple” rules (typically based on its neighbors). The whole point of this is to study emergent behaviours from simple rules in a (large) population. One example is a ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Child Hoarding</title><link href="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/child-simulation/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Child Hoarding" /><published>2022-03-20T00:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2022-03-20T00:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://jiduque.github.io/posts/child-simulation/</id> <content src="https://jiduque.github.io/posts/child-simulation/" /> <author> <name>Jorge Duque</name> </author> <category term="Random" /> <category term="Probability" /> <summary> Initial Idea The other day I was thinking about a simple population model. Start with $N$ people, then select one of them with uniform probability and give it a child. So now there are $N+1$ people in the population and one of the original $N$ has one offspring. I became interested in the distribution of number of children an individual has after this process is repeated $T$ times. Initially I ... </summary> </entry> </feed>
