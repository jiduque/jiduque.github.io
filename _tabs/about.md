## Background
Although my strengths are oriented towards algorithm development (which I love), lately I have been focusing more on scalable software systems. I work as a software developer, but previously worked on algorithm development in gas detection applications and commodities trading. My current goal is to work on complex machine learning systems end-to-end and not just focus on the modeling. From an education perspective, I have an MS in applied math and a BS in math with a physics minor from The University of Houston.   


## Interests
I really enjoy mathy things and fortunately for me, math shows up in plenty of places. More specifically I like mathematical modeling, statistics, physics, and computer science. Sometimes I think about getting a PhD working on something like functional differential equations, PDE's, or data assimilation because I find those topics interesting... but I don't really want to be poor and super stressed again so I'll pass. Besides that I also enjoy making & listening to music, drinking good beer, stock trading, and doing absolutely nothing (big fan of this one).
